fight audits for ML

just use the zip files, more has to be added. In the interest of time, developed a few models and used feature selection in R and python 2 to predict the number of hits landed from features that gave the time into each five minute round, the number of seconds elapsed since a noticeable action such as a strike or missed strike happened, the cumulative totals to the time in the round instance that a fighter missed, received, or landed a strike for each fighter, and tallys per second of each fighters missed/received/landed strikes. There were two sample runs each where seven features used the first run and provided 75-82% accuracy in R and Python on 30% of the samples as the testing set that was trained on the other 70% of the samples as the training set. When more features were added that did not include correlated features side by side (such as tally/cumulative total of received hits in correlation with the other fighter's landed hits) the accuracy remained the same with the algorithms used in Python sklearn's (logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, naive bayes, and ensemble), but increased to 97-99% accuracy in R using KNN, Rpart, random forests, generalized linear models, global boosted machines, and a type of ensemble algorithm that combines the best results of all other algorithms.
